4. Submit your sitemap: `yourdomain.com/sitemap-index.xml`

#### Check Coverage Report:
1. Click **"Coverage"** in sidebar
2. Look for errors (red):
   - **404 errors**: Create redirects in vercel.json
   - **Crawl errors**: Fix broken links
   - **Blocked pages**: Check robots.txt

Tell Claude:
```
"These pages have 404 errors [paste list].
Add redirects in vercel.json to fix them."
```

#### Fix "Alternate Page with Proper Canonical":
This means Google found duplicates. Tell Claude:
```
"Google shows these as alternate pages [paste list].
Ensure canonical tags are consistent."
```

#### Handle "Page with Redirect":
Usually www vs non-www issues. Tell Claude:
```
"Add a redirect from www to non-www in vercel.json"
```

### Common GSC Fixes with Claude

#### For 404 Errors:
```
"Add these redirects to vercel.json:
/old-url ‚Üí /new-url
/broken-page ‚Üí /correct-page"
```

#### For Mobile Issues:
```
"Check mobile responsiveness and fix any issues GSC reports"
```

#### For Core Web Vitals:
```
"GSC shows poor Core Web Vitals. 
Optimize images and improve load speed."
```

### The CSP Font Fix
If fonts break after adding redirects, tell Claude:
```
"Update the Content Security Policy in vercel.json to allow:
- style-src: add https://fonts.googleapis.com
- font-src: add https://fonts.gstatic.com"
```

### Pro GSC Tips:
- Check weekly, fix immediately
- Validate fixes after deploying
- Request indexing for important pages
